<p class="p1">Ships are build at shipyards using blueprints and help you get about in the galaxy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ship cards are placed in standard card protectors so you can write on them with dry-erase pens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mark up things like what weapons are charged, your speed, and any damage taken.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Your engines generate power on your ship that helps you move and fire weapons. Phasers take 1 unit of power to charge and corps take 1 unit on two consecutive turns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once charged, your weapons remain charged until you use them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You never have enough power to move fast and charge your weapons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Speed is Life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When resolving damage, the faster ship fires first and damage is resolved in order. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">At the end of a skirmish, the winner is the one who did the most damage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both parties keep the damage on their ships and return them to the shipyard or homeworld for repairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can only repair ships at a dock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your homeworld has 1 doc and your shipyard has 4.</p>
