Freighters can transport 3 cubes from planet to planet and have no weapons.  It’a a good idea to assign escorts to your freighters or have escorts hanging out in shipping lanes.  Place the 3 cubes on the ship card and move the ship card from  space to space on your map. 

Ship Boxes:
	•	4 power form the 4 engines
	•	1 command center
	•	3 hull
	•	3 freight (hit on any weapon hit)
