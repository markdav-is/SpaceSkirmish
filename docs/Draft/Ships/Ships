Ships are build at shipyards using blueprints and help you get about in the galaxy.  Ship cards are placed in standard card protectors so you can write on them with dry-erase pens.  Mark up things like what weapons are charged, your speed, and any damage taken.

Your engines generate power on your ship that helps you move and fire weapons. Phasers take 1 unit of power to charge and corps take 1 unit on two consecutive turns.  Once charged, your weapons remain charged until you use them.  You never have enough power to move fast and charge your weapons. 

Speed is Life.  When resolving damage, the faster ship fires first and damage is resolved in order.  

At the end of a skirmish, the winner is the one who did the most damage.

Both parties keep the damage on their ships and return them to the shipyard or homeworld for repairs.  You can only repair ships at a dock.  Your homeworld has 1 doc and your shipyard has 4.
